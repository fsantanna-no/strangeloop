\section{Abstract}
The origins of reactive programming date back to the early 80's with the 
co-development of two styles of synchronous languages:
%
The imperative style of Esterel organizes programs with control flow 
primitives, such as sequences, repetitions, and also parallelism.
%
The dataflow style of Lustre represents programs as graphs of values, in which 
a change to a node updates its dependencies automatically.

In recent years, Functional Reactive Programming modernized the dataflow style 
and became mainstream, producing a number of languages and libraries, such as
Flapjax, Rx (from Microsoft), React (from Facebook), and Elm.
%
In contrast, the imperative style did not follow this trend and is now confined 
to the domain of real-time embedded control systems.
% such as flight control on avionics and anti-collision equipment on automobiles.

We present the programming language \CEU, a contemporary outlook of imperative 
reactivity that aims to expand the application domain of this family with new 
abstraction mechanisms.
%which supports a rich set of control abstractions and static safety 
%guarantees.
%
\CEU has its roots on Esterel and relies on a similar synchronous and 
deterministic execution model that simplifies the reasoning about concurrency 
aspects.
%
%In particular, the disciplined stepwise synchronous execution of programs 
%allows for concurrent lines to safely share variables.
%
The example below in \CEU prints the ``Hello World!'' message every second, 
terminating with a key press:

\begin{verbatim}
    par/or do
       every 1s do
          print("Hello World!");
       end
    with
       await KEY;
    end
\end{verbatim}

The use of control primitives, such as \code{await}, \code{every}, and 
\code{par/or}, hides most complexity related to flows of execution and their 
life cycles (e.g. starting, aborting, and resuming them).
%
In particular, the \code{await} statement is the most representative of \CEU, 
capturing the imperative and reactive nature of the language at the same time.
%
Awaiting multiple events in parallel releases programmers from the infamous 
\emph{callback hell}, which is often a concern in general purpose imperative 
languages.

The new abstraction mechanisms of \CEU to be presented expands classical object 
orientation with instances that are reactive to the environment.
%
They make imperative reactivity suitable for applications outside the embedded 
domain.
%
As an example, we implemented in \CEU a game of moderate complexity for 
Android.
%(approximately 5,000 lines of code).
%
The imperative reactive style of \CEU is an effective alternative to Functional 
Reactive Programming that complements the realm of synchronous programming.

\begin{comment}
programs close to specification

adv: convenience of imperative w/o the burden
also solves the callback hell
- big gap for imperative reactivity
